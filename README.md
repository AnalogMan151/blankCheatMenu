# Pokémon Sun & Moon Cheat Plugin

A plugin created using [@RyDog199](https://github.com/RyDog199/)'s [blankCheatMenu](https://github.com/RyDog199/blankCheatMenu) base which in turn was based off [@Nanquitas](https://github.com/Nanquitas/) work.

In this release I have chosen to remove any codes that could make illegitimate Pokémon such as Catch Trainer's Pokémon, Learn any TM, and Pokémon spawning.

This is a work in progress and a learning exercise. The Gateshark cheats these codes were derived from can be found in the resources folder.
